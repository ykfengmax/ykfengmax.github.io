***Welcome to my webpage!***

I am a senior undergraduate student at Nanjing University in China, majoring in mathematics. In my junior year, I visited University of Wisconsin-Madison in the United States where I studied in both the thematic track of mathematics and in the music school. My math interest lies in algebra and geometry. I also like cello, piano, photography and more.
